In this section, we will describe how to install, config and start `Bigfile`.

### Requirements

The only thing **Bigfile** needs is **Mysql**, you should start mysql before starting **Bigfile**. You can follow the [official guide](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) to install it,

### Install

There are many ways to install `Bigfile`, just as follows.

#### from Binary

You can download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/bigfile/bigfile/releases).

#### from HomeBrew

If you work on MacOS, you can install `Bigfile` by [brew](https://brew.sh/).

```
brew install bigfile/tap/bigfile
```

#### from Snapcraft

Snaps are containerised software packages that are simple to create and install. They auto-update and are safe to run. More detailed information can be found in [Official Documentation](https://snapcraft.io/).

```
sudo snap install --classic bigfile
```

#### from deb/rpm

You can download the `.dep` or `rpm` file and install it by command `dpkg -i ` or `rpm -i`.

#### from scoop

If you work on Windows platform, there is an alternative solution for installing `Bigfile` by [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

```
scoop bucket add bigfile https://github.com/bigfile/bigfile-bucket.git

scoop install bigfile
```

#### from Source Code

Start `Bigfile` by `go run` command

```
go get -u -v github.com/bigfile/bigfile/artisan

go run artisan/bigfile.go --version
```

Install `Bigfile` by `go install` command. This will generate a executable binary file that's named as `artisan` in `${GOPATH}/bin`.

```
go install -a -v github.com/bigfile/bigfile/artisan
```

Build `Bigfile` by `go build` command

```
go build artisan/bigfile.go
```


### Configuration

Bigfile has a set of default configuration, Here it is:

```yaml
database:
  driver: mysql
  host: localhost
  user: root
  password: root
  port: 3306
  dbName: bigfile
log:
  console:
    enable: true
    level: info
    format: '%{color:bold}[%{time:2006/01/02 15:04:05.000}] %{pid} %{level:.5s} %{color:reset} %{message}'
  file:
    enable: true
    path: storage/logs/bigfile.log
    level: warn
    format: '[%{time:2006/01/02 15:04:05.000}] %{pid} %{longfile} %{longfunc} %{callpath} â–¶ %{level:.4s} %{message}'
    maxBytesPerFile: 52428800
http:
  apiPrefix: /api/bigfile
  accessLogFile: storage/logs/bigfile.http.access.log
  limitRateByIPEnable: false
  limitRateByIPInterval: 1000
  limitRateByIPMaxNum: 100
  corsEnable: false
  corsAllowOrigins:
    - '*'
  corsAllowMethods:
    - PUT
    - PATCH
    - DELETE
  corsAllowHeaders:
    - Origin
  corsExposeHeaders:
    - 'Content-Length'
  corsAllowCredentials: true
  corsAllowAllOrigins: false
  corsMaxAge: 3600
chunk:
  rootPath: storage/chunks
```

Bigfiel will find configuration file in `current directory`, `user home` and `/etc/bigfile`. You need to place a file named `.bigfile.yml` in one of the directories. 

If you just want to set database information, you can config it by command line.

![config-in-command-line](/start/config-in-command.png)

like this:

```
bigfile --db-host 192.168.0.104 --db-name bigfile_tesg ftp:start --tls-enable --cert-file server.pem --key-file server.key
```

### Run

After installation and configuration, it's time to run `Bigfile`. `Bigfile` has three services: `HTTP Server`, `RPC Server` and `FTP Server`, you need to start them separately.

Before running `Bigfile`, we recommend to generate a series of certificates to use tls/ssl. We provide a simple command for this:

```
bigfile rpc:make-cert
```

![generate-certificates](/start/generate-certificates.png)


After this command, six certificate files will be generated in the corresponding directory on the host. The certificate authority is prefixed with `ca`. Only the certificate authority has the qualification to issue the certificate. The certificate generated by us is a self-signed certificate. The self-signed certificate is generally not trusted by the system, but you can add it to the system for trust. The server certificate is prefixed with `server`, and the server certificate can be added with a trusted IP, specified by the parameter `--server-cert-ips`. Client-prefixed for the client, this is mainly used in the RPC service to achieve double-ended authentication. The `.pem` suffix indicates the PEM-encoded certificate file, and the `.key` suffix indicates the certificate key.

#### Start HTTP Server

```
bigfile http:start --cert-file server.pem --cert-key server.key
```

#### Start RPC Server

```
bigfile rpc:start --ca-cert ca.pem --server-cert server.pem --server-key server.key
```

![start-rpc-server](/start/start-rpc-server.png)


#### Start FTP Server

```
bigfile ftp:start --tls-enable --cert-file server.pem --key-file server.key
```

### Docker 

If you are a Docker enthusiast, we have built an official image, you can find a more detailed manual [https://hub.docker.com/r/bigfile/bigfile](https://hub.docker.com/r/bigfile/bigfile).
